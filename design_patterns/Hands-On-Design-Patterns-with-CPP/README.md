This is the code repository for [Hands-On Design Patterns with C++](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-design-patterns-c?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788832564 ), published by Packt.

**Solve common C++ problems with modern design patterns and build robust applications**

## What is this book about?
C++ is a general-purpose programming language built with a bias towards embedded programming and systems programming. Design patterns are, in essence, a library of reusable components, only for software architecture, not for a concrete implementation.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Recognize some of the most common design patterns used in C++, and what additional information is expressed by their use in context. 
* Understand how to use C++ generic programming to solve some of the most common design problems. 
* Explore the most powerful C++ idioms, their strengths, and drawbacks. 
* Rediscover some of the most popular C++ idioms, such as Resource Acquisition Is Initialization, and learn the new ways they can be used together with generic programming. 
* Understand the impact of different design and implementation choices on the program performance, and how to write well-designed and readable programs without sacrificing performance.

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
template <typename T> 
T increment(T x) { return x + 1; }
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for experienced C++ developers and programmers who wish to learn about software design patterns and principles and apply them to create robust, reusable, and easily maintainable apps.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-18).
### Software and Hardware List

### Errata
* The code block at page 43 _should be_ as follows:
```
Group<int, long> g(3, 5);
int(g); // 3
long(g); // 5

```
* Page 429: The first code block on this page should be as follows:
```
void Point::accept(Visitor& v){
    v.visit(x_);    // double
    v.visit(y_);    // double
}

void Circle::accept(Visitor& v){
    v.visit(c_);    // Point
    v.visit(r_);    // double
}

void Line::accept(Visitor& v){
    v.visit(p1_);    // Point
    v.visit(p2_);    // Point
}
```
