/***************************************************************************************
 *
 * Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a
 * researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
 *
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h
 *if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h
 *papers have no more than h citations each."
 *
 * For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher
 *has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations
 *respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each
 *and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
 *
 * Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as
 *the h-index.
 *

/*
 * Solutions
 * =========
 *
 * A simple solution would be to sort the vector and then run through it
 * starting with the last element. At every step we need to check whether this
 * element is not less than the remaining number of elements bigger than
 * it(including itself) and all the values of the other elements smaller than it
 * are not more than that number. The h_index is this number of elements bigger
 * than it(including itself).
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N log N)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 *
