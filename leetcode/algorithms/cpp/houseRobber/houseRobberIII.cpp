/***************************************************************************************
 *
 * The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only
 *one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has
 *one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that
 *"all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact
 *the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.
 *
 * Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without
 *alerting the police.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *     3
 *    / \
 *   2   3
 *    \   \
 *     3   1
 * Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
 * Example 2:
 *     3
 *    / \
 *   4   5
 *  / \   \
 * 1   3   1
 * Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.

/*
 * Solution 1 - O(N log N)
 * =========
 *
 * We can use a recursive function that computes the solution for every node of
 * the tree using the previous solutions calculated for the left and right
 * subtrees. At every step we have 2 options:
 *
 * 1) Take the value of the current node + the solution of the left and right
 * subtrees of each of the left and right children of the current node. 2) Take
 * the solution of the left and right subtrees of the current node, skipping
 * over its value.
 *
 * This way we can make sure that we do not pick 2 adjacent nodes.
 *
 * If we implemented this right away we would get TLE. Thus, we need to optimize
 * the algorithm. One key observation would be that we only need to compute the
 * solution for a certain node once. We can use memoization to calculate every
 * value once and then retrieve it when we get subsequent calls. As the header
 * of the recursive function doesn't allow additional parameters we can use a
 * map to link every node(a pointer) to its solution(an int). For every call the
 * map lookup of an element and its insertion take logarithmic time and there
 * are a constant number of calls for each node. Thus, the algorithm takes O(N
 * log N) time to finish.
